# EEG-Based-Epilepsy-Seizure-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning
This project uses EEG seizure data to classify epilepsy seizures with machine learning. It involves preprocessing raw EDF files and training models like Random Forest in Google Colab. The dataset is stored on Google Drive, aiming to develop an accurate model for seizure detection based on EEG signals.
